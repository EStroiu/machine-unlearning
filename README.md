# Datasets
Datasets were taken from kaggle competitions:
- [Predicting Electricity Consumption](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predicting-electricity-consumption/data)
- [Large-scale Energy Anomaly Detection (LEAD)](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/energy-anomaly-detection/data)
Since LEAD dataset is too large it was not included to the repository but can be downloaded from competition's page on kaggle or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/13gzZ8ImNV76yaG860OKyqwezJQUzMrxG)
